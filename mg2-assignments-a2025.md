# Exercise 1: Exploring the Fundamentals of Graphic Design in Motion

## Overview
This project invites you to experiment with abstraction and the core elements of graphic design through motion. Using After Effects (with optional support from Illustrator and/or Photoshop), you will create a short abstract video that explores and interprets five foundational design elements.

The goal is to understand how these visual elements can be used dynamically to create engaging and meaningful compositions without relying on figurative or representational imagery.

## Objectives
* Deepen your understanding of graphic design principles through motion
* Learn to animate visual elements in After Effects
* Develop an abstract visual language using shape, line, color, texture, and gradient

## The Five Key Elements to Explore
You are required to include all five of the following elements in your animation:

### 1. Shape
- Explore simple geometric forms like the circle, square, and triangle
- Investigate how these shapes affect balance, scale, emphasis, and rhythm

### 2. Line
- Animate different types of lines (straight, curved, thick, thin, dashed, etc.)
- Use lines to guide movement, create patterns, and define space

### 3. Color
- Use color to create mood, contrast, and harmony
- Explore limited palettes or bold, expressive color schemes

### 4. Texture
- Introduce visual or animated texture to add complexity
- Texture can be static or moving—created digitally or through scanned materials

### 5. Gradient, Transparency, and Form (Depth)
- Use gradients, opacity, and layering to simulate depth and transitions
- Play with transparency to suggest space and form

## Requirements
* Duration: 20 to 30 seconds
* Format: 1280x720, 30 fps
* Software: After Effects (Illustrator/Photoshop optional for asset creation)
* Sound: Include a soundtrack (ambient, experimental, or custom sound design—royalty-free or original)
* Style: Abstract only—no figurative or representational imagery

## Deliverables
1. Final Video (.mp4)
2. Project File (.aep) and assets
3. Submit via Omnivox 

## Project Evaluation  
* Creativity: 30% 
* Design: 30% 
* Technical Skills: 30% 
* Professionalism: 10%

> **Note:** Projects & exercises submitted on time earn 10% for professionalism. Late assignments do NOT receive marks for professionalism. Unreasonably late assignments can earn a MAXIMUM of 60% total.

# Project 1: 2.5D Photoanimation with Integrated 3D Element

## Overview
This project challenges you to transform a still photograph (or a series of photos) into a dynamic 2.5D photoanimation using parallax, depth, and camera movement in After Effects. To push the creative boundaries further, you are required to integrate at least one 3D object into your animated scene. This could be a modeled object, a 3D element created in After Effects or imported from software like Blender or Adobe Dimension.

## Objectives
* Learn how to break down a photo into depth layers for parallax animation
* Create depth and movement using a virtual camera in 3D space
* Integrate a 3D object into a photographic environment
* Develop storytelling and atmosphere through motion and composition

## Requirements
* Length: 10 seconds
* Format: 1280x720, 30 fps
* Software: After Effects (Photoshop, Blender, or Dimension optional for asset creation)
* Content:
  - Animate at least one photo using the 2.5D parallax technique (multiple images allowed)
  - Use multiple layers (foreground, midground, background)
  - Include camera animation in 3D space
  - Include at least one 3D object integrated seamlessly into the composition (can be stylized or realistic)

## Deliverables
* Final Video (.mp4)
* Project File (.aep) and assets
* Submit via Omnivox

## Project Evaluation  
* Creativity: 30% 
* Design: 30% 
* Technical Skills: 30% 
* Professionalism: 10%

## Tips for Success
* Choose a high-resolution photo with depth potential
* Carefully separate layers in Photoshop before importing to After Effects
* Use depth of field and camera easing to create realism
* Match lighting and perspective when placing the 3D object
* Subtle motion is often more effective than exaggerated movement

# Project 2: Modeling, Rigging, and Animating a Four-Legged Creature with Physics Effects

## Objective
Create an original four-legged creature modeled in Blender, rigged using Rigify, animated, and incorporating interactive elements using particle systems and physics forces (collisions, force fields, etc.).

## Deliverables
* A rendered video in MP4 format, 1280x720 resolution, with a minimum duration of 10 seconds
* The complete .blend source file, including all assets used

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Modeling
* The creature must be designed from scratch
* It must have four functional legs and a believable or stylized anatomical structure

### 2. Rigging
* Use Rigify to generate a functional rig
* Adjust the rig to work with the topology of your creature

### 3. Animation
* Create a smooth and expressive animation of the creature (e.g., walking, jumping, interacting with the environment)
* The animation must be at least 10 seconds long

### 4. Physics Effects
* Integrate particle system and collision

## Submission Format
* MP4 file (1280x720) named: `Creature_YourName.mp4`
* Blender file named: `Creature_YourName.blend`
* Submit via Omnivox 

## Project Evaluation  
* Creativity: 30% 
* Design: 30% 
* Technical Skills: 30% 
* Professionalism: 10%
